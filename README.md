# Online course template for R courses

This course template is based on @ines's [R course starter repo](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r). The front-end is powered by
[Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/) and [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) and the
back-end code execution uses [Binder](https://mybinder.org) :heart:
